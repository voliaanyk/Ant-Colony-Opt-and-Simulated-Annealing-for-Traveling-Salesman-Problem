## ANALYSIS
### What is the problem and why am I trying to solve it?

The problem I want to solve is creating an **AI** *(Artificial Intelegence)* model, more specifically a **GNN** *(Graph Neural Network)* model
to efficiently find **the shortest path** between any two vertices in any given graph.

Each graph consists of vertices (can also be called nodes) which are connected by edges. 
Graphs are widely used in computer science to represent variety of things like roads between cities, 
social networks, data organization, flow in tubes etc. Graph theory is a part of discrete mathematics that studies graphs.
